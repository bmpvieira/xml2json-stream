xml2json-stream
===============

This module converts simple (but eventually huge) XML data to JSON, using Streams and sax.
No support for attributes and some other XML stuff, as this was made more specifically for NCBI's Blast results files, but some features should be easy to add in the future.
Everything is stored in memory during conversion. Although, if the data source is too large for that, but mostly composed of a repetitive tag (i.e., the XML is a huge array of objects) that tag can be specified (with `tag`) and data will be emitted every time the tag is closed (with all of it's nested tags). Caches are cleared afterwards, thus avoiding memory limits. In this case, the output will be composed of one object per line, representing each repetition of the specified tag, instead of one object representing the whole XML data.
For example, for huge NCBI's Blast files, `tag` could be `iteration`.

Install
=======
npm install xml2json-stream

Options
=======
`tag` - String (optional). Used to specify a repetitive tag of interest that should be emitted each time it's closed, followed by a clean up of caches to avoid memory limits with huge data sources / files.

Usage
=====
var fs = require('fs')
  , xml2json = require('xml2json-stream')
  , parser = new xml2json.Parser('iteration')
  , input = fs.createReadStream(process.argv[2])
  , output = fs.createWriteStream(process.argv[3]);

input.pipe(parser).pipe(output);
